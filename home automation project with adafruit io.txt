Use 3 sensor values 
then simply use the sense hat emulator value

temperature
humidity
DHT11 sensor


now physically connect 2 LEDs / relay module

and then try to create a complete home automation project

where the values of 3 sensors will be sent to server once every minute
and the user is capable of switching devices in his/her home
whenever the user wants to
